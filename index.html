                        <p class="lead">
                            We are glad to announce the <strong>1st european Knowledge-Guided Machine learning workshop</strong>, to be held in Turin, Italy in ECML-PKDD 2023. Both the workshop and the main conference will run in hybrid mode, with the possibility to attend in person or remotely.
                            <br>
                            All the information about the conference can be found at the <a href="https://2023.ecmlpkdd.org/">official website</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though machine learning (ML) algorithms are reaching surprising results in various research fields, they still have limitations when facing specific problems, especially when they are black boxes. Notably, data-driven models have met with limited success in many scientific domains. This is due to their large data requirements, inability to produce physically consistent results, and lack of generalizability to out-of-sample scenarios. Instead of a purely data-driven approach that ignores decades (sometimes centuries) of accumulated knowledge in the science domains, there is an increasing interest in Knowledge Guided Machine Learning (KGML) approaches to integrate such knowledge into the ML models. This goal can also be addressed by leveraging insights and methods from the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) field.
                            <br>
                            The popularity and success of ML-based systems has put issues such as explainability, bias, fairness, and sustainability. Addressing these issues naturally leads to systems in which domain knowledge and symbolic representations play a central role. On the other hand, ML also offers solutions for long-standing challenges in the field of KR, for instance related to efficient, neurally-guided, noise-tolerant and ampliative inference, knowledge acquisition, and the limitations of symbolic representations. The synergy between ML and KR has the potential to lead to new advancements in fundamental AI challenges including, but not limited to, learning symbolic generalizations from raw (multi-modal) data, using knowledge to facilitate data-efficient learning, speeding up inference, supporting interpretability of learned outcomes and integration of symbolic planning and reinforcement learning.
                            <br><br>
                            The workshop aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a dedicated forum for discussing new ideas and research results at the intersection of machine learning and knowledge representation.
