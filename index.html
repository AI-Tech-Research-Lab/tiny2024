                        <p>
                            Even though machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have achieved amazing results in
                            many commercial and business applications, data-driven models have so far met with limited success in
                            many scientific domains. Limitations of data-driven models arise due to their intrinsic black-box nature,
                            their large data requirements, their inability to produce physically consistent results, and the lack of
                            generalizability to out-of-sample scenarios. More generally, the popularity and success of ML-based systems
                            has put the spotlight on issues such as explainability, bias, fairness, and sustainability. There is thus a
                            growing interest in developing <strong>Knowledge Guided Machine Learning (KGML)</strong> approaches that can leverage
                            decades (sometimes centuries) of accumulated scientific knowledge and combine them with ML techniques
                            to reap the benefits of both approaches. Addressing these issues naturally leads to systems in which
                            representation of prior and domain knowledge in various forms, from physical and simulation models to
                            symbolic and logical representations, plays a central role and must be integrated into ML models and
                            pipelines. On the other hand, ML also offers solutions for long-standing challenges in the field of Knowledge
                            Representation (KR), for instance related to efficient, neurally-guided, noise-tolerant and ampliative
                            inference, knowledge acquisition, efficient reasoning, and limitations of existing physical and symbolic
                            models. The synergy between ML and KR has the potential to lead to new advancements in fundamental AI
                            challenges including, but not limited to, learning symbolic generalizations from raw (multi-modal) data,
                            using knowledge to facilitate data-efficient learning, speeding up inference, supporting interpretability of
                            learned outcomes and integration of symbolic planning and reinforcement learning.
                            <br><br>
                            The workshop aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a dedicated forum for discussing new
                            ideas and research results at the intersection of machine learning and knowledge representation, both
                            from a theoretical and application standpoint.

                            Even though machine learning (ML) algorithms are reaching surprising results in various research fields, they still have limitations when facing specific problems, especially when they are black boxes. Notably, data-driven models have met with limited success in many scientific domains. This is due to their large data requirements, inability to produce physically consistent results, and lack of generalizability to out-of-sample scenarios. Instead of a purely data-driven approach that ignores decades (sometimes centuries) of accumulated knowledge in the science domains, there is an increasing interest in Knowledge Guided Machine Learning (KGML) approaches to integrate such knowledge into the ML models. This goal can also be addressed by leveraging insights and methods from the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) field.

                                                <em>When introducing neurosymbolic integration to researchers, one is often met with the question: “But why bother? Can’t I just machine learn it?”. Surprisingly often – particularly, when considering the current popularity of ML (and particularly DL) in academic research and the popular press – the answer is “No, you can’t.”. In this talk, we will have a look at the main motivation(s) for why integrating between symbolic and subsymbolic computation is often desirable, if not unavoidable. We will have a look at several use cases (taken from a variety of domains ranging from biomedical research to multisensory perception and context-adaptive robot control) which as of today appear to be almost impossible to solve without making recourse to both ML- and logic-based approaches. We will identify some of the reasons why a combination between data and knowledge is required, and will consider some of the most common ways of how to combine symbolic and subsymbolic aspects in solving the corresponding challenges.</em>
